<H1> ABSTRACT </H1>
Numerous similarity hashing methods have been developed in response to the growing demand for quick and reliable identification of duplicate or similar content in digital files. In order to compare and analyze the similarity of various file kinds, such as text, audio, and video, this work discusses the design and implementation of a web-based platform that makes use of similarity hashing algorithms: SDEEP, TLSH (Trend Micro Locality Sensitive Hash), and MRSH-V2. Users can upload files to the platform, which functions as a tool equivalent to a plagiarism detector, and receive a comprehensive comparison report highlighting content similarity. This project's main goal is to assess how well these algorithms work to identify similar information in a variety of file formats, with an emphasis on scalability, accuracy, computational efficiency, and memory utilization. Users can quickly execute similarity checks with the platform's user-friendly interface, and the files are methodically processed and analyzed by the backend using the chosen hashing algorithms. The platform's performance is evaluated in terms of its capacity to identify content similarity, manage false positives and negatives, and use resources efficiently during the comparison process through a series of controlled trials. The outcomes of these tests provide insightful information about the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm, enabling users to select the approach that best suits their requirements. This project provides a comparative examination of the most popular fuzzy hashing approaches, which not only adds to the body of research on the subject but also demonstrates the usefulness of similarity hashing in an approachable web setting. The purpose of this study is to provide guidance for the development of more sophisticated and precise content similarity detection methods, specifically for academic plagiarism detection and content verification
